IkonBoard Redirect Setup Instructions

Step One

Open the ikonboard.cgi file from the Converters download and locate the following line:

$URL_TO_IPB = "http://www.example.com/forums";


Change http://www.example.com/forums here to the full URL of your IP.Board installation. Please ensure that the URL does NOT include a trailing slash at the end.

Step Two

In your old IkonBoard directory - take a backup of the current ikonboard.cgi file and upload the file from the Converters download to this location, overwriting the old one.

Step Three

Upload the ikonboard.php file from the Converters download to the root of your new IP.Board installation, where conf_global.php and initdata.php are located.
